The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used for mining frequent item sets and generating association rules in transactional datasets. It works on the principle of "Apriori," which states that if an itemset is frequent, all of its subsets must also be frequent. The algorithm iteratively identifies frequent item sets and prunes the non-frequent ones, making it efficient for discovering relationships between items in large datasets. It is widely used in market basket analysis to understand consumer purchasing patterns.

This dataset contains transactional data with attributes such as Member_number, Date, itemDescription, and temporal information like year, month, day, and day_of_week. By applying the Apriori algorithm, we aim to identify frequently purchased items together and uncover association rules that describe the relationships between different products. The findings can help retailers optimize inventory, create targeted promotions, and improve cross-selling strategies based on customer buying patterns.
